look at it! first off it’s ugly as hell it looks like it was made in 2009. also when you first show up the first thing you see is a yellow “oh no no results”  MF I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT MY SEARCH FILTERS ARE! then there’s all these boxes and idk what they mean? its a CAR SHARING SITE there should be picturessss of carssss. cars are fun! why isn’t this site fun? not to mention the broken formatting of the username in the top right. okay “my messages” is something i have never clicked on in my life, and it very easily could go in “my account” because who is using it? and “feedback”? god they make themselves look so desperate. anyway the visual way of the time is pretty intuitive actually but why can’t i use it to search for time??

going into the site, in my mind i will have a general time that i need a car for, and i will also have a specific lot that i would prefer that car to be in. but that’s about it. very simple needs and a very simple goal. and i would definitely want to see some “partial matches” that overlap but don’t totally fit with my desired time. all really ned to see is “what day/days you want a car?”, “what time you need it for?” and “here’s everything that’s available”. if i don’t enter any constraints in i don’t want there to be any constraints applied. i should almost see some sort of “feed” - like oh okay here are the cars available today maybe, not, never, “no cars available”. and there shouldn’t need to be a “legend” - everything should be self-explanatory. I wanna see exactly where i can select a time, what cars are available for that time, and that’s pretty much it. it’d be good to be able to select my location on a map or something, and then the cars could be sorted by distance. there should be a clear cause and effect between me selecting a time and the cars that populate.
